### Write-up on the approach taken for the UI Design Idea
When we look at the sky, we are forever enchanted by the moon and the stars and planets. Even in this hitech age, the solar system remains an enigma. Our aim is to provide a captivating  interactive interface, to dive into the real world of planets, to reach the final frontier of space research and enjoy the mix of fact and fiction generated by the _'Solar Force'_. A total of 38 screens were created to cover most aspects of the app and the app mockups were created using Figma plugins and Vectary 3D.
